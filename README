Hi All,

I'm in the process of upgrading this app to be 8.x compatible - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1922/

Now this app used the Python Splunklib SDK so I also downloaded the latest from here and replaced it - 
https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-python

I've got it working and it passes appinspect

Only problem is it doesn't pass Splunk's 8.x Upgrade Readiness Checker App - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4698/

The culprit seems to be the latest splunklib Python SDK. I'm sure it will be fine just thought I would ping the devs to either fix the warnings or get the Upgrade Readiness devs to exclude the warnings for splunklib.
